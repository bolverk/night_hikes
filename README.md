# Night Hikes
A list of treks where you could hike during the night.

A while ago Israel Nature and Parks authority had a list of all reserves where hikers could stay after sunset. It has since been taken off their website. Luckily, with the help of the internet archive, I was able to reproduce this [list](http://web.archive.org/web/20090719125049/http://192.117.141.2/MokedTeva/website/mokedteva.new/tools/?tools=night+treck)

It then occurred to me that storing this data here may be a nice exercise in using geojson.
